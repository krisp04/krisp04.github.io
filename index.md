### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 
   
    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first time ever working with code. This lab taught me how to use github and work on code. Without this lab I would have trouble working and coding through github.

* Lab 7
    
    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it is a more advanced game that we coded a couple labs back. I was able to write a function that allows players to know how many guesses they have. This was a great experience for me and I learned a lot while doing this lab. 

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, part 2 was one of my favorite labs. It was one of my favorites because I was able to write functions that implemented different files in the code. The function was able to hold a secret number in a file then be opened in another file.
